# Python
csv2fasta.py and fastq2fasta.py are small scripts that I often use in my work.
bp_search_1_2_3_v5.py is a part of my current project to find chromosome rearrangements using NGS datasets sequenced with the Oxford Nanopore platform. This part of code convert alignment from SAM format into ZW format, select only alignments which satisfies the boundary conditions and min read length, classify alignments into L and R, filter by quality.
